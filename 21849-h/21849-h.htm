<h3 class = "act"><a name = "act1" id = "act1">THE FIRST ACT</a></h3>

<p class = "scenedesc">
The scene is a drawing-room, prettily but somewhat showily decorated.
The walls are papered with a design representing large clusters of white
and purple lilac. The furniture is covered with a chintz of similar
pattern, and the curtains, carpet, and lamp-shades correspond.</p>

<p class = "scenedesc">
In the wall facing the spectator are two windows, and midway between the
windows there is the entrance to a conservatory. The conservatory, which
is seen beyond, is of the kind that is built out over the portico of a
front-door, and is plentifully stocked with flowers and hung with a
velarium and green sun-blinds. In the right-hand wall there is another
window and, nearer the spectator, a&nbsp;console-table supporting a high
mirror; and in the wall on the left, opposite the console-table, there
is a double-door opening into the room, the further half of which only
is used.</p>

<p class = "scenedesc">
In the entrance to the conservatory, to the right, there is a low,
oblong tea-table at which are placed three small chairs; and near-by, on
the left, are a
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
grand-piano and a music-stool. Against the piano there is a settee, and
on the extreme left, below the door, there is an arm-chair with a little
round table beside it. At the right-hand window in the wall at the back
is another settee, and facing this window and settee there is a smaller
arm-chair.</p>

<p class = "scenedesc">
Not far from the fire-place there is a writing-table with a
telephone-instrument upon it. A&nbsp;chair stands at the writing-table,
its back to the window in the wall on the right; and in front of the
table, opposing the settee by the piano, there is a third settee. On the
left of this settee, almost in the middle of the room, is an arm-chair;
and closer to the settee, on its right, are two more arm-chairs. Other
articles of furniture&mdash;a&nbsp;cabinet, “occasional” chairs, etc.,
etc.&mdash;occupy spaces against the walls.</p>

<p class = "scenedesc">
On the piano, on the console-table and cabinet, on the settee at the
back, on the round table, and upon the floor, stand huge baskets of
flowers, and other handsome floral devices in various forms, with cards
attached to them; and lying higgledy-piggledy upon the writing-table are
a heap of small packages, several little cases containing jewellery, and
a litter of paper and string. The packages and the cases of jewellery
are also accompanied by cards or letters.</p>

<p class = "scenedesc">
A fierce sunlight streams down upon the velarium, and through the green
blinds, in the conservatory.</p>

<p>If Mr. Smythe is kind enough to ask me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">Roper.</p>

<p>He <i>does</i> ask you, through me. He’s left all the arrangements to
me and Morrie Cooling. Carlton never did anything in his life; <i>I</i>
egged him on to this. I’ve been sweating at it since eleven o’clock this

<p>The fact is, Lily and I had a slight tiff coming home last night.
<span class = "stagedir">Sitting on the settee in front of the

at the Pandora. They’d had me up from Harrogate in a hurry, to take

abominably! Miss Ensor was late and we were all hanging about on the
stage, waiting for her. I’ve never felt so cold in my life, or so
lonely. Not a word of welcome, not a nod, from a single soul; simply a
blank stare occasionally from a haughty beauty with a curled lip! And at
last, when I was on the point of howling, I&nbsp;became conscious that
somebody was watching me&mdash;a&nbsp;tall, pretty thing in a lavender
frock&mdash;&mdash;</p>

quietly laid hold of my hand and held it till Dolly Ensor condescended
to stroll in. And when I got up I asked her who she was, and she told
me. “Oh, my God,” I&nbsp;said, “I’ll

<p class = "scenedesc">
The scene is an artistically decorated refreshment-saloon&mdash;or
“foyer”&mdash;on the first-circle floor of a theatre. The wall facing
the spectator is panelled partly in glass, and through the glazed panels
the corridor behind the circle, and the doors admitting to the circle,
are seen. The right-hand wall is panelled in a similar way, showing the
landing at the top of the principal staircase and an entrance to the
corridor. Some music-stands and stools are on the landing, arranged for
a small orchestra.</p>

<p class = "scenedesc">
In the right-hand wall there is a double swing-door giving on to the
landing; and in the wall at the back, opening on to, and from, the
corridor, there is a single swing-door on the left and another on the
right. The left-hand door is fastened back into the saloon by a hook.
Between the two doors in the back wall runs the refreshment-counter.</p>

<p class = "scenedesc">
In one of the further corners of the saloon there is a plaster statue
representing the Muse of Comedy, in the opposite corner a companion
figure of Dancing. In the wall on the left, the grate hidden by flowers,
is a fireplace with a fender-stool before it, and on either side of the
fireplace there is a
<span class = "pagenum">70</span>
capacious and richly upholstered arm-chair. A&nbsp;settee of like design
stands against the wall on the right between the double-door and the
spectator.</p>

<p class = "scenedesc">
The counter is decked-out as a sideboard, and at equal distances from
each other there are four round tables laid for a supper-party of
twenty-six persons. There are eight chairs at one table and six at each
of the others, the chairs being of the sort usually supplied by
ball-caterers.</p>

<a name = "act2b" id = "act2b">The curtain falls</a>, but the music of
“Mind the Paint” continues for a while. Then it ceases and, after a
short silence, the curtain rises again. The supper-tables have
disappeared and the saloon is empty of people. The musicians and their
music-stands and stools have also gone, and faintly from the distance
comes the sound of a waltz. Two settees, matching the rest of the
furniture, now stand in the centre of the saloon back-to-back, one of
them facing the counter, the other facing the spectator. <span class =
"smallcaps">Lily’s</span> bouquet lies on the nearer of the two settees,
and upon the floor there is a fan, a&nbsp;red rose that has fallen from
a lady’s corsage, and a pocket-handkerchief with a powder-puff
<span class = "pagenum">99</span>
peeping from it. On the counter there are carafes of lemonade, decanters
of spirits and syphons of soda-water, a&nbsp;bowl of
strawberries-and-cream, various dishes of cakes, boxes of cigars and
cigarettes, a&nbsp;lighted spirit-lamp, and other adjuncts of a buffet.
<span class = "smallcaps">Colonel Stidulph</span> wanders in through the
double-door as the waltz comes to an end. Feebly and dejectedly he goes
to the counter, takes a cigarette, and is lighting it when <span class =
"smallcaps">Luigi</span> and the waiters enter the door on the left. Two
of the waiters are carrying bottles of champagne in wine-coolers,
another brings a tray on which are champagne-glasses and tumblers, and
the bearded waiter follows with a large dish of sandwiches.</p>

They go out on to the landing and disappear as <span class =

<p class = "scenedesc">
The scene is <span class = "smallcaps">Lily’s</span>
boudoir&mdash;a&nbsp;room upon the second floor of her house, adjoining
her bedroom. The decorations, though delicate, are gay, with a good deal
of pink in them.</p>

<p class = "scenedesc">
In the wall facing the spectator are two doors, one on the left, the
other in the centre. The left-hand door opens into the room from the
landing, where the staircase is shown; the centre door admits to the
bedroom. In the right-hand wall there are two sash-windows giving a view
of the tops of trees growing in a square; in the opposite wall, the
grate hidden by a low, painted screen, is the fireplace.</p>

<p class = "scenedesc">
A prettily designed “fitment” runs along the left-hand wall and the
further wall, taking in the fireplace and doors as part of its scheme.
On either side of the fireplace there is a cupboard with drawers beneath
it; between the door on the left and the door in the centre is a similar
cupboard; and on the right of the centre door, extending to the
right-hand wall, there is a wardrobe with sliding doors. The cupboard
doors are glazed and curtained in pink silk.</p>

<p class = "scenedesc">
In the middle of the room, a little to the right, there is a large and
comfortable settee, and on the
<span class = "pagenum">134</span>
left of the settee is a table littered with books, magazines,
a&nbsp;scent-atomizer, a&nbsp;small silver-framed mirror, a&nbsp;case of
manicure instruments, a&nbsp;box of cigarettes and a match-stand, and
other odds and ends. Behind the table there is a fauteuil-stool, and on
the right of the table a cosy arm-chair. A&nbsp;second arm-chair stands
apart, between the table in the centre and the fireplace.</p>

<p class = "scenedesc">
On the extreme left of the room, on the nearer side of the fireplace,
there is a box-ottoman; on the other side of the room, by the nearer
window, are a small writing-table and chair; standing across the
right-hand corner, the key-board towards the further window, are a
cottage-piano and a music-stool; and at the back of the piano there is
another small chair, with some soiled gloves upon it.</p>

<p class = "scenedesc">
A quantity of music is heaped untidily on the top of the piano; one of
the wardrobe doors is open, revealing some dresses hanging within; and
the edge of a lace petticoat, with its insertion of coloured ribbon,
peeps out from under the carelessly-closed lid of the box-ottoman. Two
milliner’s hat-boxes are on the floor by the ottoman, and a pair of
satin slippers are lying, one here, one there, under the centre
table.</p>

The window-blinds are down but the daylight is seen through them.</p>

The door on the left opens and <span class = "smallcaps">Lily</span>,

<p class = "speaker">Lily.</p>

<p>On the stage! Ho, ho! Oh, you&mdash;but I mustn’t call you silly boy
again, must&nbsp;I! And what do you know <i>of</i> me, apart from the
glimpse you’ve had of me off the stage, and my being a shining light at
the Pandora? What do you know of my&mdash;what’s the
word?&mdash;origin&mdash;where and what I’ve sprung from;
<span class = "pagenum">159</span>
how I was reared; how much education I’ve received; how much I’ve
contrived to pick up of the way to behave in <i>per</i>lite society? You
can judge from poor mother, if from nothing else, that I come from
humble beginnings. Yes, but <i>how</i> humble you couldn’t <i>dream</i>,
<span class = "stagedir">making a grimace</span> not after a supper of
raw carrots!</p>

<p class = "speaker">Farncombe.</p>

<p>Do you think I <i>care</i> how humble your beginnings were! What I do

<p><span class = "stagedir">After a pause, looking at him with blinking

<i>Stoo</i>pid! Now, attend to me. What do you say to a tiny provision
shop in Kennington, over the water?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">160</span>
<p class = "speaker">Farncombe.</p>

<p>Was that&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p class = "speaker">Lily.</p>

<p><span class = "stagedir">Nodding.</span> H’m; that was my start in
the world. Father kept a small shop in Kennington&mdash;Gladwin Street,
near the Oval. We sold groceries, and butter and eggs and cheese, and
pickled-pork and paraffin. I&nbsp;was born there&mdash;on the second
floor; and in Gladwin Street I lived till I was fourteen. Then father
smashed, through the Stores cutting into our little trade. Well, hardly
smashed; that’s too imposing. The business just faded, and one morning
we didn’t bother to take the shutters down. Then, after a while, father
got a starvation berth&mdash;eighteen shillings a week!&mdash;at a
wholesale bacon warehouse&mdash;Price and Moseley’s&mdash;still over the
water; and I earned an extra five at a place in the Westminster Bridge
Road, for pasting the gilt edges on to passe-partouts from nine a.m.
till six in the evening.</p>

<p class = "speaker">Farncombe.</p>

<p><span class = "stagedir">His head bowed again.</span> Great
heavens!</p>

<p class = "speaker">Lily.</p>

<p>Not a syllable against the passe-partouts! They were the making of
me. It was the passe-partouts that brought me and Tedder together.</p>

<p class = "speaker">Farncombe.</p>

<p>Who?</p>

<p class = "speaker">Lily.</p>

<p>Tedder. In the house where I worked, a man of
<span class = "pagenum">161</span>
the name of Tedder&mdash;Ambrose Tedder&mdash;taught dancing&mdash;stage
dancing&mdash;“Tedder’s Academy of Saltatory Art”&mdash;and every time I
passed Tedder’s door, and heard his violin or piano, and the sound of
the pupils’ feet, I&mdash;! <span class = "stagedir">Breaking off and
throwing herself back.</span> Oh, lor’, if once I&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p class = "speaker">Farncombe.</p>

<p>Go on; go on.</p>

<p class = "speaker">Lily.</p>

<p>Well, ultimately Tedder took me and trained me&mdash;did it for
nix&mdash;for what he hoped to get out of me in the future. Ah, and he
<i>hasn’t</i> lost over me&mdash;poor old Ambrose! He collared a third
of my salary for ever so long; and now that the old chap’s rheumaticky
and worn out, I&mdash;oh, it’s not worth mentioning. <span class =
"stagedir">Jumping up and walking away.</span> My stars, he could teach,
could Tedder! I&nbsp;began by going to him for the last twenty minutes
of my dinner-hour. He wanted to stop <i>that</i>, because it was bad for
me, he said, to practise on a full&mdash;a&nbsp;full&mdash;! Ha, ha, ha!
On a <i>full</i>&mdash;! <span class = "stagedir">Behind the table,
resting her two hands upon it and shaking with laughter.</span> Ho, ho,
ho! As if I ever had&mdash;in those days&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p class = "speaker">Farncombe.</p>

<p><span class = "stagedir">Writhing.</span> Ah,
don’t&mdash;don’t&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p class = "speaker">Lily.</p>

<p><span class = "stagedir">Brushing the tears from her eyes.</span>
I&nbsp;was a pupil of Tedder’s for twelve months, and then he got me on
at the Canterbury; and from the Canterbury I went to Gatti’s, and from
Gatti’s to the Lane, for a few lines
<span class = "pagenum">162</span>
in the pantomime and an understudy&mdash;my first appearance in the West
End&mdash; <span class = "stagedir">singing</span> “Oh, the West End is
the best end!”&mdash;and from there I went to the old Strand, and there
Morrie Cooling spotted me, and that led to me being engaged at the
Pandora, where I ate my heart out, doing next to nothing, for two whole
years. Then came the production of <i>The Duchess of Brixton</i>, and it
was in <i>The Duchess</i>&mdash;thanks to Vincent Bland&mdash;that I
sang the “Mind the Paint” song. He believed in me, did Vincent;
<i>he</i> saw I was fit for something more than just prancing about, and
airing my ankles, in a gay frock. By Jupiter, how he fought for me;
<i>how</i> he fought for me, up to the final rehearsal! And to this day,
whenever I indulge in a prayer, you bet Vincent Bland has a paragraph
all to himself in it! <span class = "stagedir">Checking herself and
coming to <span class = "smallcaps">Farncombe</span>.</span> Oh,
but&mdash;I&nbsp;needn’t inflict quite so much of my biography on you,
need I? <span class = "stagedir">He rises.</span> Sorry. I&nbsp;merely

away from Aldershot, in the stalls at the Pandora&mdash;much the same as
<i>you’ve</i> been doing recently, and as a certain class of young
man’ll go on doing as long as the Pandora, and similar shops, continue
to flourish. Ha! How honoured we felt, we men, in those days, at knowing
some of the Pandora girls, and having the privilege of supping ’em and
standing ’em dinner on Sunday evenings! If they’d been royal princesses
we couldn’t have been more elated. <span class = "stagedir">With a
gesture.</span> Don’t jump at conclusions. It generally ended there, or
with our running into debt at a jeweller’s. <i>We</i> were young,
<i>they</i> were beautiful&mdash;or we thought ’em
<span class = "pagenum">177</span>
so; but the majority of us weren’t vicious, any more than the majority
of the girls were&mdash;though many of ’em were mighty calculating. It
would have been better for us men if all the girls <i>had</i> been
wicked; the glamour, the infatuation, the folly, would have been sooner
over, and one of us at least would have had a different tale to
tell.</p>

ottoman and <span class = "smallcaps">Lily</span> seats herself upon the
settee.</p>

<p class = "speaker">Lily.</p>

<p><span class = "stagedir">Plaintively.</span>
Nicko&mdash;Nicko&mdash;I merely wanted you to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">Jeyes.</p>

<p><span class = "stagedir">Rousing himself and speaking to <span class

introduced us?</p>

<p class = "speaker">Lily.</p>

<p>Miss Du Cane&mdash;Aggie Du Cane.</p>

<p class = "speaker">Jeyes.</p>

<p>Agnes Du Cane. <i>She’s</i> gone under. <span class = "stagedir">To
<span class = "smallcaps">Lily</span>.</span> Outside Buckley’s
oyster-bar, wasn’t it?</p>

<p class = "speaker">Lily.</p>

<p>Not outside; in the parlour.</p>

<p class = "speaker">Jeyes.</p>

<p><span class = "stagedir">To <span class =
"smallcaps">Farncombe</span>.</span> Lily had only lately come to the
Pandora&mdash;a&nbsp;pale-faced slip of a thing. <span class =
"stagedir">To <span class = "smallcaps">Lily</span>.</span> Eighteen,
weren’t you?</p>

<p class = "speaker">Lily.</p>

<p><span class = "stagedir">Nodding.</span> Eighteen.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">178</span>
<p class = "speaker">Jeyes.</p>

<p>I confess I wasn’t overwhelmingly attracted by her at first; she was
so unlike the rest. <span class = "stagedir">Laughing bitterly.</span>
Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p class = "speaker">Lily.</p>

<p><span class = "stagedir">Weakly.</span> Ha, ha, ha! Wasn’t I
dowdy!</p>

<p class = "speaker">Jeyes.</p>

<p>But she was humble, and naïve, and confiding; and my vanity was
tickled by her delight at the little treats I gave her, and by her
gratitude for a tuppeny-ha’penny present or two. Nobody, I&nbsp;believe,
with any pretensions to being a gentleman, had paid her much attention
before I arrived on the scene.</p>

<p class = "speaker">Lily.</p>

<p><span class = "stagedir">In a murmur.</span> No; nobody.</p>

<p class = "speaker">Jeyes.</p>

<p>I didn’t find out that I was in love with her&mdash;you guess it’s a
love story, don’t you?&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">Farncombe.</p>

<p><span class = "stagedir">Delicately.</span> My dear Captain
Jeyes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">Jeyes.</p>

<p>I didn’t find out that I was neck and heels in love with her until
nearly a year afterwards, when my regiment went to the Curragh.
<i>That</i> did it&mdash;separation! What I suffered in that hole,
thinking of her, starving for her! In less than three months I was in
London again, on leave, and in my old stall at the
<span class = "pagenum">179</span>
Pandora. But even then, Farncombe, I hadn’t your pluck.</p>

<p class = "speaker">Farncombe.</p>

<p>Pluck?</p>

<p class = "speaker">Jeyes.</p>

<p>The pluck to snap my fingers at the world and propose marriage to a
Pandora girl. Besides, my mother was alive then, and&mdash; <span class
= "stagedir">abruptly, with a wild look</span> would you like to know
what <i>she</i> used to call these Pandora women, Farncombe? <span class
= "stagedir">Bending forward, his hands tightly clenched.</span> She
used to call them <i>a menace to society</i>. With their beauty, and
their flagrant opportunities for displaying it, they are a living curse,
she used to say&mdash;a&nbsp;source of constant dread to mothers whose
hope it is to see their sons safely mated to modest, maidenly girls of
the typical English pattern. She told us once&mdash;my brothers and
me&mdash;frightened as to where <i>we</i> were drifting, that she was
one of many mothers who prayed on their knees daily that their boys
might be spared from being drawn into the net woven by their own
weaknesses and passions&mdash;drawn into it by
these&mdash;these&mdash;&mdash;! <span class = "stagedir">He breaks off,
stares about him for a moment, and then rises.</span> Oh, but I oughtn’t
to have repeated this to <i>you</i>. Pardon. <span class =
"stagedir">Walking away unsteadily.</span> Ho, damned bad taste! <span
class = "stagedir">Behind the table, supporting himself by leaning upon
it.</span> Where was&nbsp;I? Back from the Curragh! <span class =
"stagedir">Confused.</span> Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;and so things went on
for a couple o’ years&mdash;I&nbsp;trailing after Lily closer than
ever&mdash;and at last&mdash;at last I <i>did</i> ask her to be my
wife.</p>

<p class = "speaker">Lily.</p>

<p><span class = "stagedir">Who has been listening to <span class =
"smallcaps">Jeyes</span> with parted lips
<span class = "pagenum">180</span>
and wide-open eyes&mdash;appealingly.</span> Don’t! Don’t, Nicko;
don’t!</p>

<p class = "speaker">Jeyes.</p>

<p><span class = "stagedir">Oblivious of her interruption.</span> But
I’d left it too late. The novelty of me had worn off; she’d scores of
friends by that time; she’d made her big hit, and followed it with
another, and was the talk o’ the town. And she’d money; she wasn’t
dependent on <i>me</i> any longer for her gloves and her trips and
outings!</p>

<p class = "speaker">Lily.</p>

<p><span class = "stagedir">Her head drooping.</span> Oh! Oh! <span
class = "stagedir">Wringing her hands.</span> Oh, that’s <i>beastly</i>
of you; <i>beastly</i>!</p>

<p class = "speaker">Jeyes.</p>

<p>She was kind to me too, in a way&mdash;kind and cruel. She didn’t
want to marry me; she didn’t want to marry anybody; she was in love with
herself, and her success, and what it was bringing her. But she wouldn’t
give me the kick. No, she wouldn’t do that; I&nbsp;<i>had</i> been
something to her. And there’s where the kindness came in&mdash;and the
merciless cruelty. <span class = "stagedir">Sitting upon the
fauteuil-stool rigidly.</span> God, if only she’d broken with me then,
firmly and finally&mdash;if only she’d broken with me
then&mdash;she&mdash;she might have saved me!</p>

<p class = "speaker">Lily.</p>

<p><span class = "stagedir">Struggling with her tears.</span> Oh, Nicko,
Nicko!</p>

<p class = "speaker">Jeyes.</p>

<p>Twelve months ago she did throw me a bone. The regiment was under
orders for India, and of
<span class = "pagenum">181</span>
course I sent in my papers; and out of pity, I&nbsp;suppose&mdash;and
because I was always pestering her&mdash;she promised to become engaged
to me if I’d get other work to do. Work! I&nbsp;wonder whether really
she was grinning to herself when she made the stipulation!</p>

<p class = "speaker">Lily.</p>

<p>Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p class = "speaker">Jeyes.</p>

<p>Work! All the spunk, all the energy, had been sapped out of me long
before, and even her promise couldn’t revive it. My search for a berth
wasn’t much more than a sham. At the back of my head I knew very well
what I’d come to. The only work <i>I</i> was capable of was dancing
attendance on <i>her</i>, and filling in what remained of the day and
night at a rotten restaurant, a&nbsp;Bohemian club, and the bar of the
theatre. And that’s <i>been</i> my sole employment for the past
year&mdash;nothing but that. Pretty, for a man who started life as
swimmingly as I did! <span class = "stagedir">His voice dying
away.</span>
Pretty&mdash;pretty&mdash;pretty&mdash;pretty&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p class = "speaker">Lily.</p>

<p><span class = "stagedir">After a profound stillness.</span>
I&mdash;I&nbsp;don’t think you’ve ever&mdash;put the case to
me&mdash;quite so plainly as this, Nicko.</p>

<p class = "speaker">Jeyes.</p>

<p>I&mdash;I don’t think I’ve ever put it quite so plainly&mdash;to
myself.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">182</span>
<p class = "speaker">Lily.</p>

<p><span class = "stagedir">Her lip trembling.</span> You&mdash;you
won’t believe me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">Jeyes.</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p class = "speaker">Lily.</p>

<p>I&mdash;I’ve never fully realised it till now&mdash;the harm I’ve
done you. I&nbsp;declare to God I’ve never realised it till now. <span
class = "stagedir">Faintly.</span> Nicko&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p class = "speaker">Jeyes.</p>

<p><span class = "stagedir">After a further pause.</span> Ah,
well&mdash;! <span class = "stagedir">With a deep sigh.</span> Ah, well!
<span class = "stagedir">To <span class = "smallcaps">Farncombe</span>,
resignedly.</span> Farncombe, I&mdash;I’m afraid I’m a shocking brute.
I&mdash;I&nbsp;got carried away. Forget&mdash;forget the things I’ve
said of this girl. Forget ’em, will yer? <span class =
"stagedir">Starting to his feet.</span> And look here! A&nbsp;man who
isn’t a sportsman deserves to be shot. You’ve won her; I’ve lost her.
Congratulate yer, old chap; congratulate yer! <span class =
"stagedir">Pulling on his cap.</span> Take care of her, that’s all;
m-m-mind you take care of her!</p>

<p class = "stagedir">
He turns towards the door and she jumps up and runs to him and seizes
his arm. <span class = "smallcaps">Farncombe</span> also rises.</p>

<p class = "speaker">Lily.</p>

<p>No, no, Nicko! Nicko&mdash;! <span class = "stagedir">Giving <span
class = "smallcaps">Farncombe</span> a half frightened, half imploring
look.</span> Nicko, I&nbsp;can’t undo the mischief I’ve done;
I&nbsp;can’t do that. But I can try to make it up to you&mdash;some of
it&mdash;and I will, if you’ll let me. <span class = "stagedir">Putting
her arms round his shoulders.</span> Nicko&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<span class = "pagenum">183</span>
<p class = "speaker">Jeyes.</p>

<p><span class = "stagedir">Her face close to his.</span> You know what
I mean! As soon as possible&mdash;next month, if you like&mdash;next
week&mdash;quietly&mdash;! <span class = "stagedir">He grips her arms
and stares at her blankly.</span> Ha, ha! Yes, you’ve been in too great
a hurry to settle matters, <i>you</i> have. Lord Farncombe and
I&mdash;we&mdash;<i>we’re</i> not going to be married. I’ve refused him.
<span class = "stagedir">Wildly.</span> I&mdash;I’ve ruined <i>you</i>,

into my net! <span class = "stagedir">Clinging to <span class =

crying.</span> Oh! Oh! Oh! I’m not going to draw <i>him</i> into my

<p class = "stagedir">
Again there is a pause and then <span class = "smallcaps">Jeyes</span>
turns to <span class = "smallcaps">Farncombe</span>, dazed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">Jeyes.</p>

<p>Farncombe&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p class = "speaker">Farncombe.</p>

<p><span class = "stagedir">Inclining his head.</span>

I&mdash;I&nbsp;want to have one more word with Lord Farncombe&mdash;just

<span class = "pagenum">184</span>
then you must walk away together, you and he, and part good friends.
<span class = "stagedir">He goes out on to the landing and she closes
the door and stands with her back to it, drying her eyes with her
handkerchief. <span class = "smallcaps">Farncombe</span>, still carrying
his hat and overcoat, has crossed to the settee, a&nbsp;forlorn

<p class = "speaker">Farncombe.</p>

sound.</span> Ah! <span class = "stagedir">Partly closing
<span class = "pagenum">187</span>
the door, she wanders about the room aimlessly for a while. Then,
impulsively, she runs to the further window, lifts the sash, and looks

She shuts the window and comes to the settee and, sitting there, takes

<p>Y-yes?</p>

<p><span class = "stagedir">To <span class =

<p class = "speaker">Lily.</p>

<p>W-w-why, Nicko?</p>

<p class = "speaker">Jeyes.</p>

<p>I’ll tell you, my dear. You remember, when we left you early this
morning, ordering us to walk away together and to part good friends?</p>

<p class = "speaker">Lily.</p>

<p>P-perfectly.</p>

<p class = "speaker">Jeyes.</p>

<p>Well, we did walk away together, and we did part good friends. But we
didn’t part at all till some hours later, in his rooms. We didn’t part
till I’d made
<span class = "pagenum">223</span>
him stand by me and listen to me while I had a long jaw with my brother

<p>About that Rhodesian business.</p>

<p class = "speaker">Lily.</p>

<p>What Rhodesian business?</p>

<p class = "speaker">Jeyes.</p>

<p>I mentioned it to you yesterday. Bob owns a third, with Peter
Chalmers and Tom Dalby, of a group of farms near Bulawayo, and he’s been
badgering me eternally to cut this and to settle out there as their
agent. <span class = "stagedir">Simply.</span> And I’ve accepted, old

<p class = "speaker">Lily.</p>

<p><span class = "stagedir">With a blank face.</span> Ac-cepted?</p>

<p class = "speaker">Jeyes.</p>

action against me, to recover damages for a broken heart. <span class =
"stagedir">Drawing a deep breath.</span> Yes, I’m chucking you, Lil.
I&nbsp;give you formal notice of my intention; and you can drive down to
your solicitors this afternoon and instruct them to writ me without

them; I&mdash;I&mdash;I’ve come to my senses, and I’m not going to
permit it. <span class = "stagedir">Bending forward.</span> Oh, my dear,
why should I make you pay for the weaknesses of my character? Because
that’s what it ’ud amount to. I’ve bullied you for having played
skittles with my life, my career. So you <i>have</i>! Damn it, so you
have! But you’ve done it out of blind thoughtlessness; and if I’d been a

landed me where I am&mdash;not you nor fifty Pandora girls! <span class

Again there is a pause, and then <span class = "smallcaps">Lily</span>
struggles to her feet and holds out her hand to <span class =

<p><span class = "stagedir">In a fright.</span> And&mdash;and drawing
Eddie into my net!</p>

<p class = "speaker">Jeyes.</p>

<p>Oh, we’ve talked of that too, he and I. He’s given me an account of
what passed between you here. My dear girl, your conscience may be quite
clear on that
<span class = "pagenum">226</span>
point. Nobody can ever reproach <i>you</i> with trying to draw him into

<p class = "speaker">Lily.</p>

<p>They <i>would</i>&mdash;they <i>would</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">Jeyes.</p>

<p>At all events, the task you have to face now is to prove to the

playing “lead” on a bigger stage than the stage of the Pandora. <span

Nicko; it’s not nearly that! Nicko&mdash;! <span class = "stagedir">She
passes him, moving towards the door on the left as if to intercept him,
and then turns to him. A&nbsp;strip of ribbon lies upon the spot where

<p class = "stagedir">
They face one another, laughing, and then she sits upon the
